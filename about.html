                </h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Jacob Diaz, I am a Computer Science / Mathematics Joint Honours student at the University of Manitoba. Growing up in rural
                    Manitoba I often had to make my own entertainment, and this usually came from online communities and video games. I immersed myself in video
                    games and soon wanted to understand how I could make one myself. Throughout my high school studies I tasked myself with learning C# and Unity,
                    along with many other software utilized in game development like Adobe Photoshop, Premier Pro, Blender, and more. By the time I graduated
                    high school I had completed numerous commissions and prototypes, and I was confident with my programming knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My passion for mathematics evolved alongside my passion for computers. From a young age I attempted to teach myself aspects of computer science,
                    but it was only when I was presented with higher level mathematics that I started to understand computer languages. Mathematics
                    have always played a part in my life and I had an amazing teacher throughout high school that motivated me to strive for more and pursue mathematics alongside
                    my computer science studies. I love the way mathematics makes me think in an abstract, analytical and objective way.

                                I never expected to learn as much as I have in my university career so far. I have studied a wide variety of topics ranging from assembly code and micro-architectures,
                                to computer graphics and artificial intelligence. I just finished a recent paper in a Fall 2020 course regarding AI on the topic of optimization of decentralized
                                multi-agent systems, my first formal paper in my field of study. Finally, I was never satisfied with the options to create websites online so I took some of
                                my winter break to learn HTML and CSS to create this website. I plan to adapt my formal JavaScript knowledge as well to further enhance this website and make it
                                more interactive.

                                I find that math gives me a very strong basis to build my computer science knowledge off of. I have been really enjoying practical applications of
                                multivariable calculus like optimization and the likes of Green's theorem, and Fubini's theorem. More recently I have been studying real and numerical analysis.
                                Numerical approaches to complex problems are like nothing I have seen before, and their ties to the computer science is a very new and exciting field that I am
                                look forward to diving into more. Finally I like to take matters into my own hands and learn topics that aren't offered in my program, primarily related mathematical
                                topics in physics, statistics, and economics.

                                Game development was my entry into computer science. As far back as middle school I remember wanting to work on a video game and my first language was
                                Batch, the Windows command prompt language. I'd create text RPG games in Batch with simple commands and show them to friends and family. I then moved
                                on to learning Unity and C#. Quit a large jump, but I fell as though it payed off in the end.
                                Beginning to learn C# from a young age was incredibly tough and I'm still learning more every day, But now I can say I am very confident with
                                C# and I have worked on all kinds of projects and commissions. I've also taken part in a few game jams, they are very fun and I plan to take part
                                in many more in the future.
                            </p>

                                University has greatly expanded the breadth of not only the programming languages I write, but also the way I tackle problems and polish my code. I have
                                taken what I have learned through university and applied them to game development in the form of new systems and tools. For example, after my recent computer graphics course
                                I have branched out to learning High-Level Shader Language (HLSL) on my own. I use HLSL not only to create interesting visuals, but to also leverage the power
                                of the GPU for computation and optimization. You can see my game development projects and more in the <a href="projects.html" class="projlink">projects</a> section of my site!

                                Music has has always played a role in my life in some way. In the past I have taken up the alto saxophone, drums, and most notably the piano. As my studies became more demanding my time to play
                                instruments dwindled, but I still wanted to be a part of my community's music scene, so I became a "roadie" for my school's musical productions. Over the years
                                the volunteer work proved to be extremely rewarding and the knowledge of musical productions, audio equipment, and safety standards was invaluable. As of recent, the pandemic has given me
                                more time and so I decided to learn the guitar. I've been playing for months now and I've fallen back in love with playing instruments once again.

                                I have an interest for aquatic life and freshwater ecology, and I like to keep fish as well as freshwater plants as a hobby. It's very rewarding to
                                feed and upkeep an entire ecosystem. I have taken care of many different fish and I plan to take care of
                                many more in the future.

# My Website's Code

My entire website [jacobdiaz.ca](jacobdiaz.ca) is here as a JetBrains WebStorm project using HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, and React.

I am by no means a web-dev professional, but I've been able to work up to a point that I'm happy with. A React based website that adapts to the screen size, shows off my skills and projects, and allows people to get in contact with me via a Google Firebase backend :)

I've also purchased the domain jacobdiaz.ca, and used some DNS magic to make it work alongside it's host site, Github Pages.

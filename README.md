# My Website's Code

My entire website [jacobdiaz.ca](jacobdiaz.ca) is here as a JetBrains WebStorm project using HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, and React.

I am by no means a web-dev professional, but I've been able to work up to a point that I'm happy with. A React based website that adapts to the screen size, shows off my skills and projects, and allows people to get in contact with me via a Google Firebase backend :)

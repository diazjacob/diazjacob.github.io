                    <h2>New Website</h2>
                    <p>
                        I have been looking at website builders for the past year, but nothing gave me the flexibility I wanted. So I decided to start the year by learning CSS and HTML
                        in order to create my own site from scratch, and you're on it right now! It's been very rewarding to see my code in action and I am planning on expanding my
                        site further by incorporating movement and interactivity with some of the JavaScript I picked up from my coursework. I decided to use Github Pages
                        to host this site because of my familiarity with git. Finally, after forwarding the domain to my personal jacobdiaz.ca everything seems to be shaping up nicely.

                    <h2>Multi-Agent Boid Optimization</h2>
                    <p>
                        I have had an interest in the "Boid" model for a a while, and my recent course in artificial intelligence gave me a chance to research and write about it.
                        My paper touched on the behaviour of these large chaotic swarms, and the optimization of the calculations involved. I utilized Unity 3D, C#, and HLSL to
                        perform the simulations with my final and optimal solution a mixture of CPU and GPU calculations working together. I learned a lot over the course of this
                        paper, and I look forward to diving deeper into AI this Winter 2021 semester.

                    <h2>Mobile Game</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mobile applications have always interested me. The ability to build applications and have them available in my pocket is very intriguing, and I feel like it
                        opens so many doors. My current project utilizes coherent procedural noise algorithms like Simplex, Perlin, and Voronoi noise to generate infinite landscapes for the
                        player to fly over in their hot air balloon as they complete delivery and mapping tasks. It is a casual mobile game that features infinite noise generation, a wind
                        simulation system, a damage simulation system, and a quest system all wrapped up with minimalistic graphics. I plan to release it to the public early 2021.

                    New Website
                </h1>
                <p>
                    <img src="img/test.png" class="textwrapL">
                    For my previous year of Computer Science Co-op I went with a simple website builder (tied to a hosting service) to supplement my
                    resume. It got me by, but overall I was disappointed with the lack of flexibility it offered. I wanted
                    more but never looked deeper at the time. My university program does not offer any introduction to HTML/CSS
                    or courses on web development, so with the new year I decided to take matters into my own hands and pick up
                    web development.


                    After search the internet for good resources I came across some great documentation, as well as example videos.
                    I'm comfortable with documentation but when learning a new language seeing the direct cause and affect
                    of an experienced programmer writing code themselves really helps to solidify big concepts. After studying up
                    and looking though documentation and forms I was one step closer to my new site.

                    I decided to use Github Pages to host the site. This is because I am 1) very familiar with git from my
                    commission work, and 2) Github Pages seemed easy to use (which proved to be true). There is copious amounts of
                    nice documentation and I've never had an issue with it. After setting up my account
                    and deciding on Jetbrains WebStorm as my IDE of choice I could begin building.

                    <br/>

                    I first learned formatting and created a basic workflow from idea to a git push. I could then move on to
                    block out my site and place my work on it. I utilized both Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premier Pro along with OBS
                    to record and edit the media content you see all over the site. My final task was to change my domain.
                    I don't really have an issue with a standard github project domain, but since I already owned one I thought
                    I should use it. My domain is registered through GoDaddy.com, and it was quite simple to setup a redirect from
                    jacobdiaz.ca to my github website, but there was an issue. A simple web redirect still maintains the
                    standard github link, and sends you to that. I wanted to <i>fully use</i> my own domain to the point
                    where you could be convinced it was the site's regular domain and nothing more.

                    This is where <i>domain forwarding</i> comes into play. Where a domain redirect simply sends you to the request
                    site like a link, a domain forward forces your chosen domain to act as if it is the true domain. This is
                    achieved through editing the domain's Domain Name Server (DNS), the server that tells your computer where
                    to truly find the site through IP addresses. After
                    lots of messing with IP configurations in the backend of my domain I eventually got the result I was looking for.
                    <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">
                        This link
                    </a> is what helped me the most with understanding these concepts.

                    Over time I slowly realized that all the concepts of HTML and CSS are the same as many of
                    the other languages I know, and it really just takes time. I previously dismissed web development work as "easy"
                    or maybe even "boring", but im definitely realizing how fun it can be and how rewarding it is to create
                    and upkeep a website! Thank you for visiting :)
